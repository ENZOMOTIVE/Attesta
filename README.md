# Attesta: Digital Credential Issuer for University


## Introduction
Attesta is a cutting-edge Certificate Attestation System designed to transform the management, issuance, and verification of academic and professional credentials. Built on the Celo Alfajores Network and deployed by DRPC (Distributed Records and Proof of Credentials), Attesta leverages blockchain technology to create immutable and tamper-proof records for certificates issued by educational institutions and professional organizations. By utilizing the Sign Protocol for schema creation and attestations through its SDK, the system ensures the secure and efficient handling of credentials. This solution guarantees the authenticity and trustworthiness of credentials, providing a transparent and decentralized platform for managing them in a secure manner.
